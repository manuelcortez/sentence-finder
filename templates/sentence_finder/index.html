<h2>How it works?</h2>

<p>This simple Django application has been created to help me studying russian sentences and later has been extended to add multiple languages. It works by querying a database wich already contains the complete list of sentences found in the <a href="https://tatoeba.org/">Tatoeba project </a> for the supported languages. Right now, the database contains {{total}} sentences, so things may go slow from time to time once a search has been started. Every page will contain a maximum of 100 sentences, and you can go to the next, previous, first or last page, if there are more than 100 results.</p>

<p>Additionally, you can click in any sentence to hear how it should be spoken.</p>

<h2>Caveats</h2>

<ul><li>Searches are made with "like"statements in the DJango ORM. It means that they are not exact and searching a word may find other similar ones (for example, searching читаю may return sentences including similar words like прочитаю, считаю, читают; searching testing may include results like protesting, etc).</li>
<li>Text to speech is made with the Google Text to Speech engine and should work in All HTML 5 compatible browsers (Firefox and Chrome in windows have been tested, and Chrome in Android).</li></ul>

<h2>Resources</h2>

<p>For this application, I have used the <a href="https://tatoeba.org"/>Tatoeba project</a> for extracting all phrases from their <a href="https://tatoeba.org/downloads">CSV sentence files,</a> and the <a href="https://responsivevoice.org/">responsive voice library</a> for generating a cross platform text to speech result.</p>
